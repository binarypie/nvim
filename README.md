# My Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Overview

This configuration is built upon the LazyVim distribution and customized with a set of plugins and settings to enhance the development workflow.

## Plugins

This configuration uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to manage plugins. Here is a list of the plugins included in this configuration:

## How it Works

This configuration is loaded from `init.lua`, which bootstraps `lazy.nvim` and the rest of the configuration. The main configuration is in `lua/config/lazy.lua`, which sets up `lazy.nvim` and loads the plugins.

The plugins are defined in `lua/plugins/`. The file `lua/plugins/example.lua` contains the custom plugin configurations. Any file in this directory is automatically loaded by `lazy.nvim`.

The `lazy-lock.json` file is used to lock the versions of the plugins, ensuring that the configuration is reproducible.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim`.
2.  Delete the .git folder
3.  Start Neovim. `lazy.nvim` will automatically install the plugins.
